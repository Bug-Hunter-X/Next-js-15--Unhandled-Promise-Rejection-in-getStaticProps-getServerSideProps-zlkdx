In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using the `async/await` syntax within a custom `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` function, especially when dealing with external API calls or database interactions.  The issue often manifests as unexpected behavior, incorrect data rendering, or even crashes during the build process. This can happen if error handling isn't robust enough or if there's an unhandled promise rejection within the asynchronous operation.
